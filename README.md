addStyleSheet(`
  *:before {
    content: 'Hello'
  }

  *:after {
    content: 'World'
  }
`)
```

## Metadata
You need to write the metadata as comments at the beginning of the script,
refer to the example for the format.

### @name
The name of the user script.

### @match
Specifies which pages this user script will be injected into.

See [Chrome Extensions match patterns].

[Chrome Extensions match patterns]: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/match_patterns/

You can specify multiple patterns via multiple `@match`.

### @update-url
The update URL of the user script.
This is optional, Eternity accesses the URL to keep the user script up to date.

You can specify multiple update URLs via multiple `@update-url`.
Eternity will check them one by one in order until a usable user script is found.

### @world
[The JavaScript world] for a user script to execute within.
This is optional, the default value is the same as the extension API.
